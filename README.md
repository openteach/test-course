# test-book
Repository showing general structure of a book.

The book in this repository is in the folder `book`. This
means that the instructor should configure this book as
follows:

```
{
    "ghUser" : "openteach",
    "ghRepo" : "test-course",
    "base"   : "/book"
}
```

There are numerous reasons for this structure:

* Multiple books in same repository
* Books in the same repository as the instructor files
